Host Based Authentication (HBA)
===============================

.. NOTE::

   *Host Based Authentication* (HBA) is an Enterprise Edition feature.

This section explains how to configure CrateDB client connection and authentication.

By default, the boolean setting ``auth.host_based.enabled`` is ``false`` and
therefore host based authentication is disabled. In this instance,
the CrateDB cluster allows any unauthenticated connections.

To allow authenticated access to CrateDB from specific hosts, you need to set
the ``auth.host_based.enabled`` setting in the ``crate.yml`` to ``true`` and
specify HBA entries in the ``auth.host_based.config`` group setting.

See: :ref:`applying-cluster-settings`.

Allowing Authentication to CrateDB
==================================

.. NOTE::

   This feature only concerns connections over :ref:`postgres_wire_protocol`.

Client access and authentication is configured by the ``auth.host_based.config``
setting in the ``crate.yml`` file.

The general format of the ``auth.host_based.config`` setting is a map of remote client
access entries, where the key of the map defines the order in which the entries
are used, which permit authentication to CrateDB. Each entry may contain no, one,
or multiple fields. Allowed fields are ``user``, ``ip`` or ``cidr``, and
``method``. The description of these fields can be found in
:ref:`host_based_auth`.

When a client sends an authentication request, CrateDB matches the provided
username and IP address against these entries to determine which authentication
method is required. If no entry matches, the client authentication request
will be denied.

If ``auth.host_based`` is not set, the host based authentication is disabled.
If the setting ``auth.host_based`` is present and the configurations list
does not contain any entry, then no client can authenticate.

For example, a host based configuration can look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    auth:
      host_based:
        enabled: true
        config:
          0:
            user: mike
            address: 32.0.0.0/8
            method: trust
          a:
            user: barb
            address: 172.16.0.0
          b:
            user: crate
            address: 32.0.0.0/8
            method: trust
          y:
            user: eleven
          z:
            method: trust

.. NOTE::

   In the ``auth.host_based.config`` setting, the order of the entries is
   defined by the natural order of the group keys of the setting.
   The authentication method of the first entry that matches the client
   user and address will be used. If the authentication attempt fails,
   subsequent entries will not be considered. The entry look-up order is
   determined by the ``order`` identifier of each entry.

In the example above:

``{user: mike, address: 32.0.0.0/8, method: trust}`` means that the user ``mike``
can authenticate to CrateDB from any IP address ranging from ``32.0.0.0`` to
``32.255.255.255``, using the ``trust`` authentication method.

``{user: crate, address: 32.0.0.0/8, method: trust}`` means that the superuser
``crate`` can authenticate to CrateDB from any IP address ranging from
``32.0.0.0`` to ``32.255.255.255``, using the ``trust`` authentication method.

``{user: barb, address: 172.16.0.0}`` means that the user ``barb`` can
authenticate to CrateDB from the ``172.16.0.0`` IP Address. Since no
authentication method is specified, the ``trust`` method will be used by default.

The entry: ``{user: eleven}`` means that the user ``eleven`` can authenticate
to CrateDB from any IP address, using the ``trust`` method.

And finally the entry ``{method: trust}`` means that any existing user (or superuser)
can authenticate to CrateDB from any IP address using the ``trust`` method.

Authenticating as a Superuser
=============================

``crate`` Superuser
-------------------

When CrateDB is started, the cluster contains one predefined superuser. This user
is called ``crate``.

To authenticate as the superuser from a specific IP address, ``crate`` should be
specified in the the ``auth.host_based`` setting, like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    auth:
      host_based:
        enabled: true
        config:
          0:
            user: crate
            address: 172.16.0.0
            method: trust
